# GRQA_src
Scripts used during the creation of the Global River Water Quality Archive (GRQA)

The scripts are divided into two folders. Folder *preprocessing* contains scripts used for preprocessing raw source data into a common structure used for GRQA. Folder *grqa_processing* contains scripts used for processing the merged data, generating plots and statistics.

Each Python script has a corresponding shell script that was used for submitting Slurm jobs on the HPC cluster of University of Tartu.
